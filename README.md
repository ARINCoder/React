# React + Vite
## {This a React project, utilizing several components like useState and useEffect(State Management)
## A hook which is useState and useEffect is a special function.
## Creating a const[ state, setState] = useState(" "), whatever is inside the useState, is considered first, and is also rendered.}
## I have learnt on importing jsx file and css file from one file to another.
## An example of a state is the onst[ input, setInput] = useState(" "), the input is the original entry and according to the principles of state management it should remain unchanged.
